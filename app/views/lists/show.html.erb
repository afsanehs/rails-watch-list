<!-- how I can show the name of the list I am currently on? -->


<!-- how do I show the movie (bookmark) I added to this list -->


<!-- @list or @list.id -->
<%= link_to "add a movie", new_list_bookmark_path(@list) %>

<!-- link between a list and movie => form with comment -->
<!-- restaurant => list
review => bookmark
if we had users, it would be like the movies -->
<!-- form with movie (dropdown), comment input -->
<%= simple_form_for [@list, @bookmark] do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :comment %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
